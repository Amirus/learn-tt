Lot's of people seem curious about type theory but it's not at all
clear how to go from no math background to understanding "Homotopical
Patch Theory" or whatever the latest cool paper is. In this repository
I've gathered links to some of the resources I've personally found
helpful.

Please keep in mind these disclaimers

 - I'm still learning
 - The resources are biased towards what I find interesting: pure type
   theory and proof theory. Lacking is references more focused on
   verification, security, any of the other countless interesting
   facets of programming languages

## Reading Advice

Here's how I read most of the resources listed below

 1. Start with the textbooks, they're mostly self-contained and are
    much clearer about their audience. They'll also give you the
    background you'll need to read other papers.

 2. When reading a paper, if you get stuck see what the paper
    references on the subject. Continue to read references until you
    eventually understand what's going on and then return to the
    paper. You'll learn *something* at least

 3. Implement often. I hard a hard time understanding a lot of these
    topics originally until I actually sat down and wrote small
    compilers/type checkers for the languages they describe. Plus it's
    fun.

 4. Have fun/preserver/try to learn something new/other annoyingly
    generic advice
