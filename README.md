Lot's of people seem curious about type theory but it's not at all
clear how to go from no math background to understanding "Homotopical
Patch Theory" or whatever the latest cool paper is. In this repository
I've gathered links to some of the resources I've personally found
helpful.

Please keep in mind these disclaimers

 - I'm still learning
 - The resources are biased towards what I find interesting, pure type
   theory and proof theory. Lacking is references more focused on
   verification, security, any of the other countless interesting
   facets of programming languages
